**Insurance Charges Prediction**  
This repository provides a machine learning pipeline to predict insurance charges based on demographic and behavioral data.  
The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn to preprocess the dataset, analyze its features, and train a regression model to predict charges accurately.  

**Features**  
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
Correlation analysis and feature importance  
Linear regression model for prediction  
Cross-validation for model evaluation  
Insights into prediction performance with error metrics and visualizations  

**Dataset**  
The dataset, insurance.csv, contains the following features:  

age: Age of the policyholder  
sex: Gender (male, female)  
bmi: Body Mass Index  
children: Number of children covered by health insurance  
smoker: Smoking status (yes, no)  
region: Residential region (southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest)  
charges: Medical charges incurred  
The target variable is charges  

**Installation**  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Insurance_Charges_Prediction.git  
cd Insurance_Charges_Prediction  
Install the required Python libraries  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

**Usage**  
jupyter notebook insurance_prediction.ipynb  

**Follow the step-by-step cells to:**  
Load and preprocess the data  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  
Train and evaluate the model  
Visualize prediction results  
Run the script on the provided dataset or replace it with a similar dataset  

**Results**

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** One of the key metrics for evaluating regression models. It measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.    
In regression problems, the output is a continuous numerical value (e.g., insurance charges), making accuracy an unsuitable metric.  
**Visual Comparison:** A plot showing actual vs. predicted charges to assess model performance intuitively.  

**Requirements**  
Python 3.7 or later  
Libraries:  
pandas  
numpy  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn  

**Install dependencies using:**  
pip install -r requirements.txt
